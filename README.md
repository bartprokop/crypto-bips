# My implementations for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal

The primary motivation behind this was to write code to generate my own paper wallet for Cryptocurrencies.
It is both manifestation of both "tin foil hat" and "don't trust anyone" as well as my curiosity to understand internals of crypto behind cryptocurrencies.

Anyway it makes it easy to generate paper wallets just by typing:

```
$ java -jar crypto-bips-1.0.2-standalone.jar -h
$ java -jar crypto-bips-1.0.2-standalone.jar bip39 -h
$ java -jar crypto-bips-1.0.2-standalone.jar bip39
$ java -jar crypto-bips-1.0.2-standalone.jar bip39 -l 128
$ java -jar crypto-bips-1.0.2-standalone.jar bip39 -l 256
```
